### 0.1.8
- Fixed a bug in the configuration loading where it would read out the incorrect
  folder.
- Added some default extensions that are blacklisted, these are known backup or
  log files.
- The server will now emit an event for every metric so you can start logging on
  why you get 404's etc.

### 0.1.7
- The `ms` module is horribly broken, now shipping with working copy of it.

### 0.1.6
- Send ping packets over the pub/sub channel to prevent it from going idle.
- Output an error when you are serving static files from a unknown directory.

### 0.1.5
- The client will automatically transform //<domain> in to https://<domain> when
  you tag a `.css` file as relative protocols cause a double download of the
  file in Internet Explorer.

- Support for deflate instead of just gzip. This will only be used if the
  `accept-encoding` headers doesn't have gzip.

  to not be called when the redis backend was configured

- Made middleware layers optional
  - The rest middleware now requires the `auth` token

- Support for HTTPS and SPDY by supplying a `ssl` configuration
- Metrics for gzip hits and misses
- Improved gzip detection by searching for obfuscated headers
- Disabled gzip for IE5/6 (without sp2)
- Enabled gzip for font-files
- Metrics now show the process.memory()

  run in development mode and don't want it prefixed with cdn servers.
